    CollisionManger
    This class will provide factories for building collision boxes
    It will also maintain all collisions in our game
    The entities will not run collisions, the manager will
    When a collision happens, the entity will be informed of the who/how 
        and be told to deal with it /sunglasses
        
    The collision manager will contain a list of all collisionBoxes in the game
    The collision manager should use a lot of static functions so we don't have to have an object for it
